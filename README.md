# YOUTUEAPIPLAYLIST - Plugin for moodle

This is a free-to-use plugin that I have made for a project with one of my clients.

It is a simle plugin with which you can easily insert a playlist in a course.

It has a simple layout and the Venobox library to get a modal window when one of the videos is clicked.

## Feel free to modify it to your liking! :)
